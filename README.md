#Welcome to the VaadHL framework
It is NOT another J2EE framework, it is a higher business logic built on top of the [Vaadin framework](http://www.vaadin.com)

It is not any replacement for the Vaadin. 

The main purpose of this framework is to build, in an efficient way, java enterprise class CRUD web applications.
 
You need a framework which can boost your productivity. 

I am glad to introduce the base part of such kind of framework.

Main features: 

  * CRUD window based.
  * High on-line customization of individual window behaviour
  * Permission checking framework.
  * Fast building by inheritance of common window types (lists and forms).
  * Internationalization
  * Save/restore window state
  * Focus on speed and reliability supported by tests on real world data amounts.
  * Tested with the Oracle and PostgreSQL databases.
  * Apache 2.0 license.
