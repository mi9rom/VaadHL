# VaadHL

<h1 style="text-align: center" /h1>Welcome to the VaadHL framework
</h1>
<p>
It is NOT another J2EE framework, it is a higher business logic built on top of the <a href="http://www.vaadin.com">Vaadin framework</a>.<br>It is not any replacement for the Vaadin.<br>
	<br> The main purpose of this framework is to build, in an
	efficient way, java enterprise class CRUD web applications. <br> You need a
	framework which can boost your productivity. <br> I am glad to
	introduce the base part of such kind of framework. <br> <br>
	Main features:
<ul>
	<li>CRUD window based.</li>
	<li>High on-line customization of individual window behaviour.</li>
	<li>Permission checking framework.</li>
	<li>Fast building by inheritance of common window types (lists and
		forms).</li>
	<li>Focus on speed and reliability supported by tests on real
		world data amounts.</li>
	<li> Tested with the Oracle and PostgreSQL databases.
	<li>Apache 2.0 license.</li>
</ul>
